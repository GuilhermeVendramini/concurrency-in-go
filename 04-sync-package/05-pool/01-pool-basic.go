	the pool since instances havenâ€™t yet been instantiated.

	<2> Here we put an instance previously retrieved back in the pool. This increases the
	available number of instances to one.

	<3> When this call is executed, we will reuse the instance previously allocated and put
	it back in the pool. The New function will not be invoked.
